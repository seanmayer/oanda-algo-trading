# Running on Minikube with Docker Hub

### Prerequisites:
- **Minikube** installed on your machine
    - Install with Brew:
      ```bash
      brew install minikube
      ```
- **Colima** installed on your machine (as a replacement for Docker Desktop)
    - Install with Brew:
      ```bash
      brew install colima
      ```
    - Start Colima to manage Docker:
      ```bash
      colima start
      ```
- **Docker** installed on your machine
    - Install with Brew:
      ```bash
      brew install docker
      ```
- **kubectl** installed on your machine (comes with Minikube)

---

### Instructions

1. **Start Colima**
   Make sure Colima is running to use Docker as the runtime:
   ```bash
   colima start
   ```

2. **Set Docker Context to Colima**
   Ensure Docker is using Colima as the active context:
   ```bash
   docker context use colima
   ```

3. **Start Minikube with Docker as the Driver**
   Start Minikube using Docker:
   ```bash
   minikube start --driver=docker
   ```
   > **Note**: The initial pull of the Minikube base image may take some time. Be patient if it appears to hang at this step.

4. **Build and Tag Your Docker Image**
   Build your Docker image and tag it for Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker build -t oanda-trading-api .
   docker tag oanda-trading-api:latest <your-dockerhub-username>/oanda-trading-api:latest
   ```

5. **Push the Image to Docker Hub**
   Log in to Docker Hub and push your image:
   ```bash
   docker login
   docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/oanda-trading-api:latest
   ```

6. **Update Kubernetes Manifest**
   Make sure your `deployment.yaml` is configured to pull the image from Docker Hub:
   ```yaml
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: oanda-trading-api
       image: <your-dockerhub-username>/oanda-trading-api:latest
       ports:
       - containerPort: 8080
   ```

7. **Deploy to Minikube**
   Apply your Kubernetes configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

8. **Access the Application**
    - Get the Minikube IP and service NodePort:
      ```bash
      minikube ip
      kubectl get svc
      ```
    - Access the application at `http://<minikube-ip>:<NodePort>`.

### Notes and Troubleshooting
- **Waiting for Image Pull**: If Minikube seems to hang while pulling the base image, wait patiently. The initial setup can take time, especially on a slow network.
- **Docker Credential Issues**: If you encounter errors related to `docker-credential-osxkeychain`, make sure to remove or update the `"credsStore"` entry in `~/.docker/config.json`.
- **Colima Resource Configuration**: If you run into performance issues, allocate more resources to Colima:
  ```bash
  colima stop
  colima start --cpu 4 --memory 4
  ```
- **Manual Base Image Pull**: If Minikube's image pull fails, you can manually pull the image:
  ```bash
  docker pull gcr.io/k8s-minikube/kicbase:v0.0.45
  ```

This setup should simplify your workflow and ensure everything runs smoothly using Docker Hub for image management. Let me know if there are any more updates or issues youâ€™d like to address!
